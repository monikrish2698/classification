# Multi-Class classification

A beginner friendly notebook for someone who is beginning with machine learning. The notebook following simple steps builds a multi-class classifier predicting the nature of texts (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, severe_threat, identity_hate).

### What can one learn from this
<li>How to implement Linear support vector classifier, Logistic regression, naive bayes</li>
<li>Build pipeline using sklearn</li>

### Any pre-requisites?
<li>Theoretical understanding on how the above model works</li>

### Explore?
<li>Try hyperparameter tuning using randomsearchCV or gridsearchCV</li>
